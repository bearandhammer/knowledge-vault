## Good

- Running.
- Fitness achievements were actually quite wild!
- Morning Walks.
- Health conscious and goal smashing (even though the goals were BS).
- Survived (most of the year was nightmarish = dumpster fire).
- Great holidays!!!
- Space we created in the garden.
- Office solution and tidying of the spare room before we froze to death.
- Claire knitted a great cardigan.
- Promotion and resolution of work role.
- Weekly Columbo (will need a replacement this year).
- Wonderful birthdays.
- Seeking out more delights in Norfolk (woods, beaches, etc.).
- Dad - goodbye cancer!
- Seeing Jayne (hug) and Mum & Dad once was brilliant.
- Lord of the rings board game = really good Christmas.
- Despite everything, MS symptoms quite stable, big boon!
- We are stronger than ever. ðŸ’ž
- Esme calling Mark 'Weak'. Perfect.

## Not So Good

- Was a dumpster fire (see above).
- IVF (brought life to a halt).
- Frog & Pencil - no time to think about it. Stalled.
- Large periods of being totally lost.
- Role issues - super draining.
- Isolation (continued) = bad.
- Slow second half of the year.

## Things to take forward/what we've learnt

- Planning and routine were very, very key (which was in place during the first half of the year). We need routine.
- No morning walk = things don't work as well. Helps with the planning of the day.
- Lacking knives, pans and possibly larger fridge are getting more problematic as time goes by. Can't prep or make meals!
- The garage is a festering black hole that sucks away all light.
- Which basically means our environment is key.
- We should be reminded that we can do hard things and, whatever happens, we will be OK.
