### Section 2: Describe Cloud Computing

#### Benefits of Cloud Computing

The ability to rent computing resources on demand - paying for what you use.

1000+ different services.

Web App - layer of abstraction. Easier to work with, no access to OS.
Function app - serverless.
Logic App - create small workflows (connecting processes).

Create resource -> shows popular services and services by category. Lew - check out the AI + Machine Learning services.

Compute - also contains Redis, Kubernetes and Docker (containers).

Marketplace - third-party resources available for use.

#### Shared Responsibility Model

How MS and the customer have divided responsibility for all sorts of things including security.

I guess this is true, we meet the provider in the middle (with responsibility to utilise supporting resources in a responsible manner). Azure will, of course, protect (by default) these resource (physical security, networking and encryption).

VMs - you need to update.
Web App/App Service - Azure responsible. Shared responsibility, to some degreee, for Network/Firewall, Application Settings and Auth platform. You are till responsible for devices, data and user accounts.

So different divides depending on the resource you select.

Cloud SaaS (software as a service). Office 365 - you don't control the application itself.

Tiers:

- VM = mixed.
- App Sevice = mixed/shared.
- SaaS = mixed/shared. Identity/accounts platform then shared. Further up abstraction chain.

PaaS - Platform as a Service.
IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service.
