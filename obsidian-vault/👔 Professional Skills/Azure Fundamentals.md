Web App - layer of abstraction. Easier to work with, no access to OS.
Function app - serverless.
Logic App - create small workflows (connecting processes).

Create resource -> shows popular services and services by category. Lew - check out the AI + Machine Learning services.

Compute - also contains Redis, Kubernetes and Docker (containers).
