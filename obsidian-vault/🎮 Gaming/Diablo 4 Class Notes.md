Phase one adjustments:

Adjust each armour piece (aspects specifically):

Do the following:

- Upgrade chest armour.
- Imprint with 'Fortify your earth skills gain two ranks.'.
- Nothing good on the first cut.
- Need boots to make it work.

Then:

- Upgrade boots.
- Imprint with 'Unstoppable and 4 seconds afterwards gain x% movement speed (move freely through enemies).'.

Then:

- Upgrade one ring:
- Landslide Pillars.

Then:

- Upgrade pants.
- Keep duration to Earthen Bulwark (it's good).

Keep gloves, weapon, one good ring and amulet for now.
