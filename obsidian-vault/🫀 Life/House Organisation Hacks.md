# House Organisation Hacks

## Kitchen
---

🔶 Kitchen mug hooks.
🔶 Kitchen spray/washing up liquid (dailer drivers) - glass spray and pump refill bottles.
🔶 Olive oil/balsamic bottle set - could use the second one for soy sauce!
🔶 Drawer organisers. Cutlery and drawer trays.
🔶 Risers/baskets to make use of vertical space.
🔶 Lazy susan - to rotate for flour/baking goods.
🔶 Joseph Joseph - compact cutlery organiser.
🔶 Tension rod for under the sink (hang bottles on - make use of vertical space).
🔶 Tension rod for use in the airing cupboard?
🔶 Baskets for use under the sink.
🔶 Joseph Joseph washing up drying rack.
🔶 Under shelf storage trays/basket.
🔶 Under sink caddy with wheels.
🔶 3m 'command' spray bottle hooks for the back of doors (under the sink).
🔶 3m 'command' sticky trays the backs of doors.
🔶 Cord wrappers (to stick to appliances).
🔶 Joseph Joseph lid holders for pans.
🔶 Over the sink cutting board (urm...game changer!).
🔶 Sink caddy.


### Notes

A lazy susan would be good where we have our plates -> we have a tonne of unused space to the left of our plates could be used.
 

## Bathroom
---

🔶 Extendable tile scrubber.
