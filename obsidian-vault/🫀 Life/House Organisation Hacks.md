# House Organisation Hacks

## Kitchen
---

ðŸ”¶ Kitchen mug hooks.
ðŸ”¶ Kitchen spray/washing up liquid (dailer drivers) - glass spray and pump refill bottles.
ðŸ”¶ Olive oil/balsamic bottle set - could use the second one for soy sauce!
ðŸ”¶ Drawer organisers. Cutlery and drawer trays.
ðŸ”¶ Risers/baskets to make use of vertical space.
ðŸ”¶ Lazy susan - to rotate for flour/baking goods.
ðŸ”¶ Joseph Joseph - compact cutlery organiser.
ðŸ”¶ Tension rod for under the sink (hang bottles on - make use of vertical space).
ðŸ”¶ Tension rod for use in the airing cupboard?
ðŸ”¶ Baskets for use under the sink.
ðŸ”¶ Joseph Joseph washing up drying rack.


### Notes

A lazy susan would be good where we have our plates -> we have a tonne of unused space to the left of our plates could be used.
