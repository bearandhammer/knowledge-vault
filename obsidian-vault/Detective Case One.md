## Case

Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland...confidential note for clarification for an unusual event.

At the Ying Auction House, a pocket watch with a gold plated bezel appeared.

Watch in DB of objects lost during WW2. Showpiece looted by Germans from the Museum of the Land in Posen, Poland. During the occupation of Poland.

1939-1944

Poles - symbolic and sentimental value. Belonged to great pianist `Ignacy Paderewski` . The watch was stolen by Nazi called (based on info from poles) `Kurt Blutholz` .

Records can be found about this guy in the database.

The Auction House bought the watch for $5000 - from `Rupert Owens`. We now have the watch in evidence.

Delicate matter!!! If `Blutholz` had live in the US postwar it would be bad for political reasons. Worse yet, the press will sniff around - scandal! Agency wants to avoid - let's find answers before questions roll in.

Sad piece of info...morning after tomorrow, at the `Olivet Cemetery` , `Michael Slater's` funeral is taking place (he helped create the unit). Hit and run - gotta be deliberate.

***MORNING OF DAY 3 - FUNERAL.***
