- Iterative, small changes.
- Small, but distinct, actions.
- Fitness is key. 
	- The walks.
	- The runs.
	- The bands.
- How about coding katas, do they have any merit.
- Lets...
	- Complete Azure course.
	- Complete .NET language features course.
	- Look at new SQL features from SQL 2016 onwards - as a breath of fresh air.
	- Pick some new Azure features (cognitive services or translater).
	- Blog posts:
		- Interactive Notebooks.
		- SonarCube setup.
		- Code metrics in Azure DevOps pipeline.
		- Makecode Arcade sample.
		- Make a unity game, why not!
		- Image comparison.
- Search for purpose.

- Idea: translation service.
- Idea: Cognitive service recap.
	- Sentiment analysis is a good one to cover.
- Idea: Neural networks. 
- Idea: DataDog Dashboards.
- Idea: https://marmelab.com/blog/2023/02/27/copilot-code-review.html

Idea: DevOps - check file content.

Could use a PowerShell refresher really - it's been too long. Will root through Udemy for a reasonable one.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1

Look at Rest API for:
- create comment. 
- get commit changes

PowerShell regex matching.
- Go for the light version?
- Just go with line, not offset, highlighting.
- Remember to set a base url var.

Build pipeline maintainability index.
Build pipeline unit test coverage.
Writing analysis (when well). 
4pm - beta download window.
- Done.
- Next...linked xbox accounts. Done.

Complete beta testing.

Purchase Udemy course - Selenium.
	Plan in Selenium cause for the next two weeks.
	Udemy - 2 days approx.
	Book in calendar time to finish...

Research build (dr).

post for regex (code analysis).
- Checked off - functions correctly.
- Done.

How to generate NuGet packages - demo done.
Query string - disection and fluent/moq tests.

API best practice:

Build pipelines:
- What account is it running as.
