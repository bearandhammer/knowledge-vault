# Blog Staging

Get whatever flavour of installation underway that you require. Once complete, you'll be presented with the following once your start the application:

At this point I generated a new GitHub repository (with just a README.md and no .gitignore, for now) and once cloned, in the root folder of the repository, created a vault using the relevant Obsidian option. This will result in something pretty close to this, whereby my repository name is 'knowledge-vault' and my vault name is 'obsidian-vault':

Image

Voila! That's a fully functional Obsidian vault ready to rock and roll. Let's focus next on getting an extension to manage automatically committing and pushing to our remote repository on a schedule.

---

The community pluging of choice for easily enabling automatic push/commits to a remote repository is Obsidian Git. For anyone curious about how this plugin is implemented you can find the source on GitHub here: https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git.

First things first, the ability to use community plugins is locked off behind a specific configuration option. You'll find this option under Settings -> Community Plugins -> Safe Mode. This does come with the caveat that community plugins do have the ability to access resources on the target device; so a degree of caution is required.

Once enable, you are free to browse, install and enable community plugins by clicking the 'Browse' button, as indicated. The following screenshot shows the flow on how to access/adjust these settings:

Browse for and install 'Obsidian Git'; post installation ensure you click the 'enable' button to turn on the plugin (all plugins, that I have tried this far, do not enable by default and wait for the user confirmation in this regard). Post installation, you should see the following if searching for the plugin again (that confirms installation is successful):

Post-installation, close the search modal to return to the Settings modal and sca through the various settings until you reach the 'Installed Plugins' section; this is where you will find an entry for Obsidian Git, that allows you to access/tweak configuration settings. The plugin will use any stock credentials you have configured for you designated workspace.

This is the configuration platter that I went with, but you can tailor this fully to your taste as desired. üç¥

Let's take a super-succinct tour of these settings and the exact meaning behind each setting. The 'Vault backup interval (minutes)' is, as you'd expect, the exact time interval between each automatic commit and push operation. Every 5 minutes is seems like a good balance between frequency and performance, although I have to admit I have noticed too much degradation as automatic commits/pushes occur. 'Auto pull interview (minutes)' is set to 0 to disable this feature, but if you are interested in pulling information (as you have a shared vault) then this could be of interest.

I prefer more clean commit history, so I have chosen 'Rebase' for the 'Sync method'; but again, dealers choice here! The next four settings ('Commit message on manual backup/commit', 'Commit message on auto backup', '{{date}} placeholder format', '{{hostname}} placeholder replacement') enable to you tailor the commit messages generated but injecting a hostname and date (in the desired format) into a template string. Of course, you are free to omit anything you don't want. For example, a final commit message in my repository is as follows:

Template string: '{{hostname}} vault backup: {{date}}'
Results in: 'Lews PC vault backup: 29/03/2022 19:49:58'

The 'List filenames affected by commit in commit body' adds any adjusted files into the body for the commit, a personal preference of mine in this case, which results in the follow effect (when viewed in GitHub):

Image

It is possible to adjust the target branch for commit/push operations by toggling the 'Current branch' setting. This could be of benefit if working on a vault using a strategy such as Git flow (or where you want to stage changes into another branch and create Pull Requests/merge into another upstream branch, perhaps in a multi-user setup).

I have opted to pull updates on startup with the aid of the 'Pull updates on startup'. To pair nicely with this, the 'Pull changes before push' is also enabled, although my vault will only be for my own personal use (this could be useful if I change committed markdown files from another device).

Lastly, the most important setting to alter here is 'Disable push'; it is critical this is turned off in order for automatic commit/pull operations to trigger.

You are now away to the races and automatic commit/push operations should trigger as you build out your own personal knowledge base (capturing configuration changes, mardown file alterations/additions, etc). For example, as I have been compiling notes for this blog post the process has triggered numerous times. In Obsidian you will see a toastr-style notification:

From a Git GUI, such as Fork, you should observe the following:

My Current Vault

If you want to checkout my current vault dedicated to weird and wonderful knowledge snippets (100% a stub-fest, at the time of writing) then you can find that here.

https://github.com/bearandhammer/knowledge-vault

The plan, for me at least, is to build out (and then attempt to tie together) my evolving thoughts on life, work, professional practices, programming, mindfulness, health and nutrition and see what seedlings form from the process. Perhaps these 'seedling' ideas will grow into something more, who knows!

Extra Resources

I would recommend this superb YouTube resource (very long but well document with copious timestamps) for anyone wanting to go on an Obisidian journey.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB89lJs5A3s

As mentioned, the software itself is not open source but is highly extensible. Contributions in the form of plugins and themes are welcome and for those interested this repository is a good starting spot.

Core plugins

Before looking at some community-driven plugins I wanted to take a very quick tour of some of the Core plugins bundled with Obsidian. Not all of these are enabled by default, so peruse the list and enable any that take your fancy.

Some of the key (and interesting ones to note) are as follows.


File Explorer

Obsidian comes with a stock File Explorer and Search capabilities (the standard search seems )

The Publish/Sync options allow access to paid services store and synchronize data; which is why I am opting for the GitHub-based approach. Pricing details can be found here, if this is on interest.
